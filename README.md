python-etce-tutorial
==

The python-etce-tutorial provides an overview of the [Extendable Test
Control Environment
(ETCE)](https://github.com/adjacentlink/python-etce).  Modeled on the
[EMANE Tutorial](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane-tutorial), ETCE
concepts are introduced through a sequence of examples. The tutorial
aims to explain ETCE with enough detail so that users can effectively
write, execute and automate their own EMANE emulations upon completion.


This project contains the configuration and scripts necessary to run the 
tutorial.
